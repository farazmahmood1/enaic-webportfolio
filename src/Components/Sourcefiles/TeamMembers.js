      "<p> I started my career as a react native mobile application developer at US SOFT in 2019. I learned a lot there, not just development but professional ethics as well. <br/><br/> I learned industrial approaches and ways of doing code. I learned using third party apps like firebase, google maps, Twilio , pusher beams, social logins, apple logins, google fencing , scheduled and event based push notification,  custom coding in JavaScript and others. <br/><br/> I spent almost 21 months at US SOFT and then i moved to ALPHANITE SOFTS PVT LTD as a team lead of mobile application developers and recently I was promoted to project manager at ALPHANITE SOFTS. <br/><br/> As a side job, I have worked remotely as a JavaScript and  react native mobile application developer for global agencies, primarily in the US and UAE. <br/><br/> As a developer, I have a lot of experience with complex coding. I have extensive experience using third party apps. I have managed many projects, which were very challenging and difficult. In my opinion development is much easier than project management. Project managers carry a lot of responsibility and pressure.  <br/>I also work part-time as a freelancer. <br/><  I have spent almost 2 years at ALPHANITE SOFTS. <br/><br/>   In short, I have almost 4 years of industry experience and acquired skills in JavaScript, React Native, and project management. </p>",
